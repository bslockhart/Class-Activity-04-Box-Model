# üìñ Implement CSS Box Model Properties to Design Layout
Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
* As a developer, I want to use the CSS box model properties to position four boxes inside a frame.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when each box has a defined `padding` property.
* It's done when each box has a defined `margin` property.
* It's done when each box has a defined `border` property.
* It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:
[MDN Web Docs on CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model)
[MDN Web Docs on padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding)
[MDN Web Docs on margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)
[MDN Web Docs on border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)

## Assets
The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## üí° Hints
1. How can we use the `margin` property to define the space between elements?
* This property can be used to set a margin on all four sides of an element. Margins create extra space around an element, unlike padding, which creates extra space within an element.

## üèÜ Bonus
* If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:
1. What is the CSS `float` property?
* The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).
